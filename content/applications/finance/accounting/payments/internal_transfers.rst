Internal money transfers can be handled in Odoo. At least two bank accounts are needed to make
internal transfers.

Configuration
=============

An internal transfer account is automatically created on your database based on your company's
localization and depending on your country’s legislation. If needed, the default :guilabel:`Internal
transfer account` can be modified by going to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration -->
Settings --> Default Accounts section`.

Register an internal transfer from one bank to another
======================================================

Log an internal transfer
------------------------

In order to transfer 1000 USD from Bank A to Bank B, from the Accounting Dashboard, click on the
drop-down selection button (:guilabel:`⋮`) on one of your banks, then click on :guilabel:`Payments`
and each payment can be marked as :guilabel:`Internal Transfer`. A :guilabel:`Destination Journal`
must be selected in order to :guilabel:`Confirm` the internal transfer.

The money is now booked in the transfer account and another payment is automatically created in the
destination journal.
