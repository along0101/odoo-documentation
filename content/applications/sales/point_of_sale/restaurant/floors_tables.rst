From the POS settings
---------------------

To create floors and tables from the backend, :ref:`access your POS' settings
<configuration/settings>` and click :guilabel:`→ Floors` under the :guilabel:`Floors & Tables Map`
category of the :guilabel:`Restaurant Mode` section.

Then, click :guilabel:`New` to create a floor, give it a name, select the point of sales where that
floor is to be displayed, and click :guilabel:`Add a line` to add some tables. Doing so opens a
pop-up window to give your table a name, a number of seats, and to link it to an appointment
resource. When satisfied with your table, click :guilabel:`Save & Close` or :guilabel:`Save & New`
or click :guilabel:`Discard` to abort.

.. note::
   - Your POS must be :ref:`configured as a bar or a restaurant <restaurant/configuration>` for that
     section to be displayed.
   - To create a map of your restaurant or bar reflecting your actual floor plan, you must open the
     POS and :ref:`edit from the frontend <floors_tables/frontend>`.

.. tip::
   Create floors on the spot: click next to Floors and start typing your floor name.Then, press
   "enter" to create it.

enter the **edit mode**.

Add a floor by clicking :guilabel:`+ Add Floor`, which opens a pop-up window where you can choose a
name for it.

Once a floor is created, add a table by clicking :guilabel:`+ TABLE`. You can move it by selecting
it and drag and dropping it as desired. Once a table is selected, you can also change the number of
seats available by clicking :guilabel:`SEATS`, the table shape by clicking :guilabel:`SHAPE`, the
table color by clicking :guilabel:`FILL`, or the table name by clicking :guilabel:`RENAME`. To

.. _floors_tables/orders:

automatically associates the order to the chosen table, allowing you to add more items and generate
a bill specifically tied to the orders placed at that table.

Once an order is placed, go back to the floor plan view by clicking :guilabel:`BACK` and select
another table to register another order.

.. note::
   As soon as you click a table, the number of guests is automatically set to one guest. If you
   select a table by mistake, click :guilabel:`Release table` to free the selected table, or
   :ref:`transfer the customer <floors_tables/transfer>` to another table.
